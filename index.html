            <h4 style="font-style: italic">Abbhinav Venkat, Chaitanya Patel, <b>Yudhik Agrawal</b>, Avinash Sharma</h4>
            <p>
                    <b>Abstract: </b>3D Human Body Reconstruction from a monocular image is an important problem in computer vision with applications in virtual and augmented reality platforms, animation industry, en-commerce domain, etc. While several of the existing works formulate it as a volumetric or parametric learning with complex and indirect reliance on re-projections of the mesh, we would like to focus on implicitly learning the mesh representation. To that end, we propose a novel model, HumanMeshNet, that regresses a template mesh's vertices, as well as receives a regularization by the 3D skeletal locations in a multi-branch, multi-task setup.
The image to mesh vertex regression is further regularized by the neighborhood constraint imposed by mesh topology ensuring smooth surface reconstruction. The proposed paradigm can theoretically learn local surface deformations induced by body shape variations and can therefore learn high-resolution meshes going ahead. 
We show comparable performance with SoA (in terms of surface and joint error) with far lesser computational complexity, modeling cost and therefore real-time reconstructions on three publicly available datasets. We also show the generalizability of the proposed paradigm for a similar task of predicting hand mesh models. Given these initial results, we would like to exploit the mesh topology in an explicit manner going ahead.

                        3D Human body reconstruction along with hairs and clothing is a bit of an ambitious task using only monocular RGB image, but with temporal data, it could be treated as a system with multiple views.

                <ul>
                        The drawback of Parametric model is that we are constrained to the fixed notion of the body with pre-defined joints like in SMPL which although makes the task easier for the network 
                        but does not have details for clothing, hairs, etc. By defining a robust non-parametric function we can incorporate the above mentioned drawbacks and do the 3D reconstruction to have hairs and clothing information.

                    Understanding controversies in online news is crucial for journalists, online social networks, and policy makers. In this research, we present a new metric, Controversy Score, for detection of controversial content in social media. The score employs a statistical approach that infers the controversiality of content from the toxicity of its comments, such that the toxicity distribution approximates either an `M' or `U' shaped distribution. We validate the approach using a dataset of 180,733 YouTube comments from an online news publisher. In addition, we build a predictive model to score controversiality of a news story even when its comments are disabled. Our findings suggest that the most engaging videos are also the most controversial ones. Furthermore, a qualitative analysis of the controversial themes suggests that the framing of the story impacts its controversiality.

                    It also makes it possible to incorporate both item and user metadata into the traditional matrix factorization algorithms. It represents each user and item as the sum of the latent representations of their features, thus allowing recommendations to generalise to new items (via item features) and to new users (via user features).<br />

                    This program is about science - but it is not limited to the way science is traditionally practiced. This is also about computer science and IT - but it is not about creating IT professionals. It is about the science that is emerging in the interface of the information revolution and the challenges posed by some of the grave issues and problems in today's world. From newer ways of acquisition and management of multivariate data on complex natural systems to newer ways of deriving knowledge from the data using novel methods of data visualization and computational simulation, the world today needs a different breed of enabled scientists who are ready to navigate this interface. This program is for those who have the inner desire to take on these grand scientific challenges.

                                Texture Synthesis: Given a finite sample of some texture, the goal is to synthesize other samples from that same texture.
                                In this, finding the nature of the image and adjusting the parameters are handled by the algorithm dynamically.
                                <br>Texture Transfer: Take the texture from one object and ‘paint’ it onto another object.

                        <p>
                            Hops while using Tor is very dynamic which causes the searches and other things to be affected by the location of the hop.
                            This decreases the effectiveness of using Tor to some extent. We provided a solution by managing the second last hop to a specific location
                            which greatly improves the efficiency of using Tor.
